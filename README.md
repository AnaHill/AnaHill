## Moro! I’m @AnaHill alias A-J Mäki
I’m a data engineer, former postdoctoral researcher, who is building resilient data solutions for customers using modern cloud platforms and tools, especially with Azure (ADF and DevOps), Databricks, PostgreSQL, and Python. 
I am also very experienced with MATLAB & Simulink and COMSOL (FEM).
